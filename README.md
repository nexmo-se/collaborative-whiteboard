# Interactive Whiteboard Sample App

This project integrates Vonage Video API with [Invisionapp] (https://www.invisionapp.com/). It shows you how you can have a multiparty call with Chat, an interactive whiteboard wher you can add items to work on, sticky notes, comments, reactions, etc. You can also live-edit a document along with the other participants (this could be any Google Doc)

## Pre-requisites

So that users can collaborate on the project, they need to be part of the same Invision project. Otherwise, the user would have read-only access. The users can become collaborators by accepeting the invite sent from the invision dashboard.

### Run the app

1. Populate the `config.js` file with some test credentials
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm start`
